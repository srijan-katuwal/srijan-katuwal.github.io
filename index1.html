                I had a great experience with Zab as my driving instructor. He is very professional and helped me to build up my comfort levels on the road. The tips and tricks he showed me not only helped me to pass the G2 test but also be a safe and responsible driver. Zab provides a very personalized experience, and helped me to work on areas that needed improvement constantly throughout the lessons. I would highly recommend Zab Driving School!"</p>

                I did my G test prep with Zab. Having previously taught by another instructor, I could clearly see how much passion and empathy(something most driving instructors lack) Zab brings to his students. He is passionate to get his students cross the finish line and goes above and beyond in guiding them to success. He’ll be my lifetime recommendation to anyone looking for an instructor. You can’t go wrong with Zab. Thank you Sir!"</p>

                  I did my G test prep with Zab. Having previously taught by another instructor, I could clearly see how much passion and empathy(something most driving instructors lack) Zab brings to his students. He is passionate to get his students cross the finish line and goes above and beyond in guiding them to success. He’ll be my lifetime recommendation to anyone looking for an instructor. You can’t go wrong with Zab. Thank you Sir!"</p>
